    "\n",
    "- __Updatable catalogs:__ A [`ProjectCatalog`](../xscen.rst#xscen.catalog.ProjectCatalog) is a *DataCatalog* with additional *write* functionalities.

    "\n",
    "- `variables_and_freqs` is used to indicate which variable and which frequency is required. <b> NOTE:</b> With the exception of fixed fields, where *'fx'* should be used, frequencies here use the `pandas` nomenclature ('D', 'H', '6H', 'MS', etc.).\n",
    "- `other_search_criteria` is used to search for specific entries in other columns of the catalog, such as *activity*. `require_all_on` can also be passed here.\n",
    "- `exclusions` is used to exclude certain simulations or keywords from the results.\n",
    "- `match_hist_and_fut` is used to indicate that RCP/SSP simulations should be matched with their *historical* counterparts.\n",
    "- `periods` is used to search for specific time periods.\n",
    "- `allow_resampling` is used to allow searching for data at higher frequencies than requested.\n",
    "- `allow_conversion` is used to allow searching for calculable variables, in the case where the requested variable would not be available.\n",
    "- `restrict_resolution` is used to limit the results to the finest or coarsest resolution available for each source.\n",
    "- `restrict_members` is used to limit the results to a maximum number of realizations for each source.\n",

The preferred way to add new methods is to [submit a new indicator to xclim](https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing.html), and then to add a call to that indicator in `conversions.yml`. In the case where this is not possible or where the transformation would be out of scope for `xclim`, the calculation can be implemented into `xscen/xclim_modules/conversions.py` instead.\n",
