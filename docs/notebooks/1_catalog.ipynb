    "- `exclusions` is used to exclude certain simulations or keywords from the results.\n",
    "- `match_hist_and_fut` is used to indicate that RCP/SSP simulations should be matched with their *historical* counterparts.\n",
    "- `periods` is used to search for specific time periods.\n",
    "- `allow_resampling` is used to allow searching for data at higher frequencies than requested.\n",

    "- `restrict_members` is used to limit the results to a maximum number of realizations for each source.\n",
