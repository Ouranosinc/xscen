Contributors: Ã‰ric Dupuis (:user:`coxipi`), Trevor James Smith (:user:`Zeitsperre`).

Changes
^^^^^^^
* Split `sdba` from `xclim` and duplicate code where needed. (:pull:`8`)
* `xclim_submodules` represent submodules that are  copy (or almost) of given modules in `xclim`. Elsewhere, more attention has been given for a cleaner integration of minimal and sufficient `xclim` functionnalities. (:pull:`8`)
* Class `Indicator` in ``indicator.py`` needs some reworking, many pieces are still artefact from `xclim` usage that won't be needed here. (:pull:`8`)
