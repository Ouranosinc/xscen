Announcements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `xscen` now adheres to PEPs 517/518/621 using the `setuptools` and `setuptools-scm` backend for building and packaging. (:pull:`292`).

New features and enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* New function ``xscen.indicators.select_inds_for_avail_vars`` to filter the indicators that can be calculated with the variables available in a ``xarray.Dataset``. (:pull:`291`).
* Replaced aggregation function ``climatological_mean()`` with ``climatological_op()`` offering more types of operations to aggregate over climatological periods. (:pull:`290`)
* Added the ability to search for simulations that reach a given warming level. (:pull:`251`).
* ``xs.spatial_mean`` now accepts the ``region="global"`` keyword to perform a global average (:issue:`94`, :pull:`260`).
* ``xs.spatial_mean`` with ``method='xESMF'`` will also automatically segmentize polygons (down to a 1Â° resolution) to ensure a correct average (:pull:`260`).
* Added documentation for `require_all_on` in `search_data_catalogs`. (:pull:`263`).
* ``xs.save_to_table`` and ``xs.io.to_table`` to transform datasets and arrays to DataFrames, but with support for multi-columns, multi-sheets and localized table of content generation.
* Better ``xs.extract.resample`` : support for weighted resampling operations when starting with frequencies coarser than daily and missing timesteps/values handling. (:issue:`80`, :issue:`93`, :pull:`265`).
* New argument ``attribute_weights`` to ``generate_weights`` to allow for custom weights. (:pull:`252`).
* ``xs.io.round_bits`` to round floating point variable up to a number of bits, allowing for a better compression. This can be combined with the saving step through argument ``"bitround"`` of ``save_to_netcdf`` and ``save_to_zarr``. (:pull:`266`).
* Added annual global tas timeseries for CMIP6's models CMCC-ESM2 (ssp245, ssp370, ssp585), EC-Earth3-CC (ssp245, ssp585), KACE-1-0-G (ssp245, ssp370, ssp585) and TaiESM1 (ssp245, ssp370). Moved global tas database to a netCDF file. (:issue:`268`, :pull:`270`).
* Implemented support for multiple levels and models in ``xs.subset_warming_level``. Better support for `DataArray` and `DataFrame` in ``xs.get_warming_level``. (:pull:`270`).
* Added the ability to directly provide an ensemble dataset to ``xs.ensemble_stats``. (:pull:`299`).
* Added support in ``xs.ensemble_stats`` for the new robustness-related functions available in `xclim`. (:pull:`299`).
* New function ``xs.ensembles.get_partition_input`` (:pull:`289`).

Breaking changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* ``climatological_mean()`` has been replaced with ``climatological_op()`` and will be abandoned in a future version. (:pull:`290`)
* ``experiment_weights`` argument in ``generate_weights`` was renamed to ``balance_experiments``. (:pull:`252`).
* New argument ``attribute_weights`` to ``generate_weights`` to allow for custom weights. (:pull:`252`).
* For a sequence of models, the output of ``xs.get_warming_level`` is now a list. Revert to a dictionary with ``output='selected'`` (:pull:`270`).
* The global average temperature database is now a netCDF, custom databases must follow the same format (:pull:`270`).

* Add argument ``moving_yearly_window`` to ``xscen.biasadjust.adjust``. (:pull:`39`).
* Many adjustments to ``parse_directory``: better wildcards (:issue:`24`), allow custom columns, fastpaths for ``parse_from_ds``, and more (:pull:`30`).
* Documentation now makes better use of autodoc to generate package index. (:pull:`41`).
* `periods` argument added to `compute_indicators` to support datasets with jumps in time (:pull:`35`).

Breaking changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Patterns in ``parse_directory`` start at the end of the paths in ``directories``. (:pull:`30`).
* Argument ``extension`` of ``parse_directory`` has been renamed ``globpattern``. (:pull:`30`).
* The ``xscen`` API and filestructure have been significantly refactored. (:issue:`40`, :pull:`41`). The following functions are available from the top-level:
    - ``adjust``, ``train``, ``ensemble_stats``, ``clisops_subset``, ``dispatch_historical_to_future``, ``extract_dataset``, ``resample``, ``restrict_by_resolution``, ``restrict_multimembers``, ``search_data_catalogs``, ``save_to_netcdf``, ``save_to_zarr``, ``rechunk``, ``compute_indicators``, ``regrid_dataset``, and ``create_mask``.
* xscen now requires geopandas and shapely (:pull:`35`).
* Following a change in intake-esm xscen now uses "cat:" to prefix the dataset attributes extracted from the catalog. All catalog-generated attributes should now be valid when saving to netCDF. (:issue:`13`, :pull:`51`).

Internal changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `parse_directory`: Fixes to `xr_open_kwargs`. (:pull:`19`).
* Fix for indicators removing the 'time' dimension. (:pull:`23`).
* Security scanning using CodeQL and GitHub Actions is now configured for the repository. (:pull:`21`).
* Bumpversion action now configured to automatically augment the version number on each merged pull request. (:pull:`21`).
* Add ``align_on = 'year'`` argument in bias adjustment converting of calendars. (:pull:`39`).
* GitHub Actions using Ubuntu-22.04 images are now configured for running testing ensemble using `tox-conda`. (:pull:`44`).
* `import xscen` smoke test is now run on all pull requests. (:pull:`44`).
* Fix for `create_mask` removing attributes (:pull:`35`).
