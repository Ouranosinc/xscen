.. note::

    If you are new to using GitHub and `git`, please read `this guide <https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/>`_ first.

.. warning::

    Anaconda Python users: Due to the complexity of some packages, the default dependency solver can take a long time to resolve the environment. Consider running the following commands in order to speed up the process::

        $ conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver
        $ conda config --set solver libmamba

    For more information, please see the following link: https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community

    Alternatively, you can use the `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ package manager, which is a drop-in replacement for ``conda``. If you are already using `mamba`, replace the following commands with ``mamba`` instead of ``conda``.

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up ``xscen`` for local development.

#. Clone the repo locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:Ouranosinc/xscen.git

#. Install your local copy into a development environment. You can create a new Anaconda development environment with::

    $ conda env create -f environment-dev.yml
    $ conda activate xscen-dev
    $ python -m pip install --editable ".[dev]"

   This installs ``xscen`` in an "editable" state, meaning that changes to the code are immediately seen by the environment.

#. As xscen was installed in editable mode, we also need to compile the translation catalogs manually::

    $ make translate

#. To ensure a consistent coding style, install the ``pre-commit`` hooks to your local clone::

    $ pre-commit install

   On commit, ``pre-commit`` will check that ``black``, ``blackdoc``, ``isort``, ``flake8``, and ``ruff`` checks are passing, perform automatic fixes if possible, and warn of violations that require intervention. If your commit fails the checks initially, simply fix the errors, re-add the files, and re-commit.

   You can also run the hooks manually with::

    $ pre-commit run -a

   If you want to skip the ``pre-commit`` hooks temporarily, you can pass the ``--no-verify`` flag to `$ git commit`.

#. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

#. When you're done making changes, we **strongly** suggest running the tests in your environment or with the help of ``tox``::

     $ python -m pytest
     # Or, to run multiple build tests
     $ tox

   Alternatively, you can run the tests using `make`::

    $ make lint
    $ make test

   Running `make lint` and `make test` demands that your runtime/dev environment have all necessary development dependencies installed.

   .. warning::

        Due to some dependencies only being available via Anaconda/conda-forge or built from source, `tox`-based testing will only work if `ESMF`_ is available in your system path. This also requires that the `ESMF_VERSION` environment variable (matching the version of ESMF installed) be accessible within your shell as well (e.g.: `$ export ESMF_VERSION=8.5.0`).

#. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   If ``pre-commit`` hooks fail, try re-committing your changes (or, if need be, you can skip them with `$ git commit --no-verify`).

#. Submit a `Pull Request <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>`_ through the GitHub website.

#. When pushing your changes to your branch on GitHub, the documentation will automatically be tested to reflect the changes in your Pull Request. This build process can take several minutes at times. If you are actively making changes that affect the documentation and wish to save time, you can compile and test your changes beforehand locally with::

    # To generate the html and open it in your browser
    $ make docs
    # To only generate the html
    $ make autodoc
    $ make -C docs html
    # To simply test that the docs pass build checks
    $ tox -e docs

   .. note::

       When building the documentation, the default behaviour is to evaluate notebooks ('nbsphinx_execute = "always"'), rather than simply parse the content ('nbsphinx_execute = "never"'). Due to their complexity, this can sometimes be a very computationally demanding task and should only be performed when necessary (i.e.: when the notebooks have been modified).

       In order to speed up documentation builds, setting a value for the environment variable "SKIP_NOTEBOOKS" (e.g. "$ export SKIP_NOTEBOOKS=1") will prevent the notebooks from being evaluated on all subsequent "$ tox -e docs" or "$ make docs" invocations.

#. Once your Pull Request has been accepted and merged to the ``main`` branch, several automated workflows will be triggered:

   - The ``bump-version.yml`` workflow will automatically bump the patch version when pull requests are pushed to the ``main`` branch on GitHub. **It is not recommended to manually bump the version in your branch when merging (non-release) pull requests (this will cause the version to be bumped twice).**
   - `ReadTheDocs` will automatically build the documentation and publish it to the `latest` branch of `xscen` documentation website.
   - If your branch is not a fork (ie: you are a maintainer), your branch will be automatically deleted.

You will have contributed your first changes to ``xscen``!

.. _translating-xscen:

Translating xscen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your additions to ``xscen`` play with plain text attributes like "long_name" or "description", you should also provide
French translations for those fields. To manage translations, xscen uses python's ``gettext`` with the help of ``babel``.

To update an attribute while enabling translation, use :py:func:`utils.add_attr` instead of a normal set-item. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        ds.attrs["description"] = "The English description"

becomes:

    .. code-block:: python

        from xscen.utils import add_attr


        def _(s):
            return s


        add_attr(ds, "description", _("English description of {a}"), a="var")

See also :py:func:`update_attr` for the special case where an attribute is updated using its previous version.

Once the code is implemented and translatable strings are marked as such, we need to extract them and catalog them in the French translation map. From the root directory of xscen, run::

    $ make findfrench

Then go edit ``xscen/xscen/data/fr/LC_MESSAGES/xscen.po`` with the correct French translations. Finally, running::

    $ make translate

This will compile the edited catalogs, allowing python to detect and use them.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

#. The pull request should include tests and should aim to provide `code coverage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage>`_ for all new lines of code. You can use the ``--cov-report html --cov xscen`` flags during the call to ``pytest`` to generate an HTML report and analyse the current test coverage.

#. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should also be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in ``README.rst``.

#. The pull request should not break the templates.

#. The pull request should work for Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11. Check that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

$ pytest tests.test_xscen

To run specific code style checks::

    $ black --check xscen tests
    $ isort --check xscen tests
    $ blackdoc --check xscen docs
    $ ruff xscen tests
    $ flake8 xscen tests

To get ``black``, ``isort ``blackdoc``, ``ruff``, and ``flake8`` (with plugins ``flake8-alphabetize`` and ``flake8-rst-docstrings``) simply install them with `pip` (or `conda`) into your environment.

Versioning/Tagging
------------------

A reminder for the **maintainers** on how to deploy. This section is only relevant when producing a new point release for the package.

.. warning::

    It is important to be aware that any changes to files found within the ``xscen`` folder (with the exception of ``xscen/__init__.py``) will trigger the ``bump-version.yml`` workflow. Be careful not to commit changes to files in this folder when preparing a new release.

#. Create a new branch from `main` (e.g. `release-0.2.0`).
#. Update the `CHANGES.rst` file to change the `Unreleased` section to the current date.
#. Bump the version in your branch to the next version (e.g. `v0.1.0 -> v0.2.0`)::

    .. code-block:: shell

        $ bump-my-version bump minor # In most cases, we will be releasing a minor version
        $ git push

#. Create a pull request from your branch to `main`.
#. Once the pull request is merged, create a new release on GitHub. On the main branch, run:

    .. code-block:: shell

        $ git tag v0.2.0
        $ git push --tags

   This will trigger a GitHub workflow to build the package and upload it to TestPyPI. At the same time, the GitHub workflow will create a draft release on GitHub. Assuming that the workflow passes, the final release can then be published on GitHub by finalizing the draft release.

#. Once the release is published, the `publish-pypi.yml` workflow will go into an `awaiting approval` mode on Github Actions. Only authorized users may approve this workflow (notifications will be sent) to trigger the upload to PyPI.

.. warning::

    Uploads to PyPI can **never** be overwritten. If you make a mistake, you will need to bump the version and re-release the package. If the package uploaded to PyPI is broken, you should modify the GitHub release to mark the package as broken, as well as yank the package (mark the version  "broken") on PyPI.

Packaging
---------

When a new version has been minted (features have been successfully integrated test coverage and stability is adequate), maintainers should update the ``pip``-installable package (wheel and source release) on PyPI as well as the binary on conda-forge.

The simple approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest approach to packaging for general support (pip wheels) requires the following packages installed:
 * build
 * setuptools
 * twine
 * wheel

From the command line on your Linux distribution, simply run the following from the clone's main dev branch::

    # To build the packages (sources and wheel)
    $ python -m build --sdist --wheel

    # To upload to PyPI
    $ twine upload dist/*
