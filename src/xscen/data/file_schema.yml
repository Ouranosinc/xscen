# This file defines the structure of the data on Ouranos' servers
#
# The path-builder function parses this tree from top to bottom, always using the first match.
# Names of the top elements are only there for reference purposes. They make cleaner error message, but are not significant otherwise.
# Each top element may define the following fields:
#
#     with: # Section that decides if we use this element for the given file.
#       - facet: < facet >         # A facet and its values to match
#         value: <value or values>  # this can be repeated
#         # This schema will then be used if the facet <facet> is one of the values listed in <values>.
#         # The absence of "value" means it is used if the facet <facet> is not empty.
#     folders: # The path structure, each element is mapped to a folder level
#       # There are four ways to specify a folder name to use:
#       - < facet >           # The value of the facet.
#       - (< facet >)         # Same, but if the facet is missing, this level is skipped, resulting in a tree of a different depth.
#       - [< facet >, < facet >, ...]:  # The folder name consists in more than one facet, concatenated with a "_" by default. They can be optional.
#       - text: < value >     # A fixed string
#     filename: # The file name schema, a list of facet names. If a facet is empty, it will be skipped. Elements will be separated by "_".
#               # The special "DATES" facet will be replaced by the most concise way found to define the temporal range covered by the file.
#               # DATES should only appear at the end.

### Derived data
#
# These schemas are meant for the output of scenario projects.
# The main differences here are that:
#
#     - domain denotes the zone over which the scenario was computed, not the original source's coverage
#     - processing_level has more possible values, denoting slight variant of the data instead of broad categories.
#     As such, both fields are here much lower in the hierarchy.
