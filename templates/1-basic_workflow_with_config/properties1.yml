# This file bears a similar purpose to indicators1.yml, but is called during the diagnostics step.
# Same as for indicators1.yml, this will create a custom xclim module using your own specifications.
# For a complete list of the possible arguments, please refer to the xclim documentation: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#indicator-tools
